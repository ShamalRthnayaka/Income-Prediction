## Overview

This project aims to tackle a simple classification problem: predicting whether an individual's income exceeds $50,000 per year based on census data. The dataset used for this task contains various demographic features such as age, education, occupation, marital status, etc.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult). It consists of approximately 32,000 observations with 14 attributes including both categorical and numerical features. The target variable is whether an individual's income exceeds $50K/yr.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**: This step involves handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features if necessary.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding the distribution of features, relationships between variables, and identifying patterns within the data.

3. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve the performance of machine learning models.

4. **Model Selection**: Experimenting with various classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc., to find the best-performing model.

5. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

6. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Fine-tuning the parameters of the chosen model to optimize its performance.

7. **Deployment**: Deploying the trained model for making predictions on new data.
